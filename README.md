This code is computing and characterizing high-order interactions among n brain areas. [1]
The High Order Jupyter Notebook is describing each functions and gives examples.

This code is used to compute the results from the pre-print _Emergence of High-Order Functional Hubs in the Human Brain_. [2]

## Prerequisites :
